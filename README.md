## Marine Biology and Ecology Department Coding Club

This organization is run by graduate students of the Marine Biology and Ecology department of RSMAS:
Allyson DeMerlis, Mike Connelly, and Nick Kron.

Welcome to our Coding Club! This repository is where we push our codes from Tidy Tuesday activities, provide resources, and recordings/documents from previous guest lectures.
